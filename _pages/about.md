Welcome! I am a 4th-year PhD candidate in Political Economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business. I am broadly interested in American Politics and Political Economy. I am especially fascinated by the interaction between political factors and economic activities from two main angles: one that emphasizes how individual labor market participation could shape one’s political ideology, and the other that revolved around how government supervises and intervenes economic activities such as firms’ merger & acquisition behaviors. 

Prior to Stanford, I was as a Pre-doctoral Fellow in Microeconomics at Columbia Graduate School of Business. I received my B.A. in Economics and German Studies from Smith College.
